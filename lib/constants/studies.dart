Character: All the qualities and features that make a person, or group of people and places different from others. Character is the mental and moral qualities distinctive to an individual.\n\nC. Synergy: The extra energy, power, success, etc. that is achieved by two or more people or companies working together instead of their own. It is also the interaction of elements that when combined produce a total effect that is greater than the sum of the individual element.\nBiblically, charisma is any quality in the life of a believer which attracts others to God through them (Acts 8:6-8). The Nine Gifts of the Spirit (1Cor. 12:7-11) are good examples of charisma in the Bible.\nMeanwhile, a manifestation of the fruit of the Spirit is a good example of character in the Bible (Gal. 5:22-23).

Jacob showed his affection upon Joseph by buying coats of so many colours for him. This in turn created hatred between him and his brethren; this was climaxed by his two powerful dreams.
