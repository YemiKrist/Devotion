    return '''The Christ Apostolic Church Students’ Association is a militant Youth and Evangelical wing of the Christ Apostolic Church Worldwide divinely established through Pastor Samuel Oluwabusuyi AriJesudade in 1970.

God has successfully raised anointed men of God to His own Glory, through the Group.
These able generals in God’s army now occupy such responsible positions in the Mission as Assembly Pastors, District Superintendents, Assistant General Superintendents. Many General Overseers and Presidents of Christian Ministries are also product of this group.

The Group has served as a source of inspiration to many youths and youth organizations both locally and internationally.

The vision at the onset was to redeem the youths of the Christ Apostolic Church Worldwide who are being swept away by the torrents of wordliness and wordly pleasures.
Today, the horizon of the vision has been broadened by the Holyspirit, its Author, to include Church planting.

To God be the glory, honour and adoration for evermore. He deserves more than we can offer as sacrifices of praise for the landmark achievements recorded so far in these five decades of existence.
Despite all odds, today the group is waxing stronger in the Lord. The Vision is alive and aglow!

Ours truly is a divine vision with a divine mission. It cannot die! Christ surely leads, and we follow. Praise God! Alleluia!
