                  'Child training is a noble assignment given to every parent blessed with children; but if not done properly, the society will be corrupt. Verse 17 of the text says “Correct thy son and he shall give thee rest; yea he shall give delight unto thy soul” Children are eternal souls therefore parents should not give in to weariness, indifference, laziness and careless neglect in the training of their children. Every child is a divine appointment which must be attended to appropriately before you can be considered successful.\nA child not well trained is already trained not to do well. The bible supported training our children: read Prov. 22:15; 23:13-14',

                  'Lyman Abbott said “a child is a beam of sunlight from the infinite and Eternal, with possibilities of virtue and vice, but as yet unstained.” Whatever you trained your children to be are what they will possibly become in future. John F. Kennedy corroborated this statement by saying that “Children are the living messages we send to a time we will not see.” Parents need both reproof and rod to train their children. They are innocent therefore must be taught the right value and corrected when erring with words and cane as it is deemed necessary. An untrained child is a potential destroyer of the society at large while an improperly trained child is worse off.',
