He was no longer a man of his word; because fear ruled him; there was no relationship between himself and the God of his fathers.\nThere is no better way to live a meaningless life than attempting to live it outside of a godly environment.',

                  'The triumphal entry refers to the religious day known as Palm Sunday that occurred one week prior to the resurrection of Jesus and the Sunday prior to His Friday crucifixion. It is recorded in all four Gospels (Mat. 21:1-17; Mk. 11:1-11; Lk. 19:29-40; Jn. 12:12-19) as one of the key events of Jesus’ earthly ministry. Jesus rode into Jerusalem on a young donkey (colt) that had never been ridden alongside another donkey. The disciples placed their cloaks on the colt for Jesus to ride. This is described as fulfilling the prophecy of Zech. 9:9: «Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your king is coming to you; righteous and having salvation is he, humble and mounted on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.»\nMany of the people of Jerusalem who saw Jesus arrive acknowledged or treated Him as royalty. Mk. 11:8 says, «And many spread their cloaks on the road, and others spread leafy branches that they had cut from the fields”. The people of Jerusalem also sang praises of Him; Mat. 21:9 shouting, “Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!’»\nThe story of the triumphal entry is one of contrasts, and those contrasts contain applications to believers. It is the story of the King who came as a lowly servant on a donkey, not a prancing steed, not in royal robes, but on the clothes of the poor and humble. Jesus Christ comes not to conquer by force as earthly kings but by love, grace, mercy, and His own sacrifice for His people. His is not a kingdom of armies and splendour but of lowliness and servanthood. He conquers not nations but hearts and minds. His message is one of peace with God, not of temporal peace.\nIf Jesus has made a triumphal entry into our hearts, He reigns there in peace and love. As His followers, we exhibit those same qualities, and the world sees the true King living and reigning in triumph in us.',

What an indisputable empty tomb!\nJesus did not only promise and raise Himself up, He also promised to raise as many as believe in Him up in the last day.

                  '\nQuotes - Parenting is not a course of study, …… it is not an art, …. but is a natural love and mutual understanding between you and your children.\n\nWe are in the 21st Century! Times have changed; both mother and father have to work. Sometimes, they have no choice but to delegate their parental roles to domestic staff, relatives, and teachers (real world). In the process, many children are abused emotionally, physically, and sexually. The effects of these forms of abuse have robbed them of their God-given childhood experience. Sadly, many parents are ignorant or claim ignorance of the fact that parenting in the 21st century requires that they become aware of the risk of delegating their roles to the real world.\n\nTelevision, video, music, the internet, social media, video games, pornography, etc. are all part of the virtual world. Our children are now influenced by a world full of sexual perversion and immorality through these medium. As Christian parents, this is one of the greatest challenges of our times.\n\nThus, parents should (1) Understand the child/don’t expect your child to understand you. (2) Avoid comparison. (3) Give them character and best personality. They are more valuable than currency and properties (4) Be the best parent: be careful in front of children. (5) Check your environment and your child’s emotions/peer groups. (6) Get information about the trend of things. (7) Attend Seminars/Workshops, get materials (CDs, books, etc.), know the language your children speak (online and offline), and share/convey vital information to your children. (8) Build Relationships: “Your children need your presence more than your presents”– Jesse Jackson. (9) Deliberately create time for your children -have discussions with them. (10) Commit them to God – Psa. 127:3\n\nIt is the responsibility of parents to bring their children to God. Do not expect that delegated parenting will yield the same result as yours. If we fail to do the needful, the future is at risk. However, children must be made to take responsibility for their actions and inactions.',

When the Lord was about leaving his house for Sodom and Gomorrah, for the execution of Divine Judgment on the pervading immorality of the city, He thought it would not be expedient to hide His mission to the city from Abraham. The Lord based the necessity of divulging the secret to him on the credibility inherent in Abraham. Firstly, he will become a great nation and the whole world will be blessed through him.\nSecondly, the Lord emphatically stressed in Gen. 18:19 «For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.»\nThe Lord Himself attested to it that Abraham will command his household after him to keep the way of the LORD; he will mentor them to do justice and judgment.

As a result he furnished him with the details of His mission to Sodom and Gomorrah; which prompted Abraham to intercede vigorously for them.\n\nThe Lord Himself testified to the mentorship quality and role modelling inherent in Abraham, which would enable his descendants to walk in the way of the Lord.

How? It is a love poem between a man and his wouldbe bride or lover. The Jewish Rabbi had traditionally interpreted the books to show the love of God for the Israelites.

Can you remember how it sounds when you hear the voice of your beloved during your courtship, especially the one that lives far from you?\nThe voice of a lover creates sensation; it arouses strong feeling, it’s ecstatic and inspirational. There is power in the voice of the Lord. Can you hear the voice of the LORD also? What is it saying unto you? See v. 10, “Rise up … and let’s go”.\nBefore the voice of love sounds, the king has perfected a place to stay read verses 11 and 12 and make sure the environment is safe for his woman. This is an antitype of many men that exposes their own woman to undue risk today.\nThe desire of the woman is to see her lover. Hear her passionate pleading: “Let me hear your voice; let me see your face” (v.14). What is the desire of today’s church?\nIs it your priority to see the face of God? Do you get sick when you don’t hear the voice of the Lord? If you are a true bride of Christ, you should seek both His voice and His face. Psa. 105:4\nLet the church of today hear the voice of the Lord. See what the voice of the Lord does in Psa. 29 (Kolaiah Psalm) and use it to pray.',

She is observant enough to know that her lover is missing beside her. She took the risk of searching the city in the dead of the night. She was decisive and desperate in her search. Many of the brides today wouldn’t even know that their lover was gone. They are like Samson who did not know that the Lord is gone away from him.\nA Bible teacher once observed the church and said: The Church is in trouble since the Lord was gone from her. Today’s study is crucial as it shows us the position of the church today. May you see the Lord as you continue to digest the Word.\n“I found Him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go”. It took her trouble to get the absent King and she won’t let him go. Examine your life\nWhat effort are you making at restoring your relationship with the Lord? Is He still with you? Don’t deceive yourself. If He is not there, go on your knees and cry for Him to return to you now. Is the Lord in our church, in our new moon and other festivals?\n“Let us search and try our ways and turn again to the Lord. Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens”. Lam. 3: 40,41.',

Visit eateries, mountain tops, Christian rest rooms (for spiritual fortifications and indepth planning of the future) with your spouse. Be proud of his (her) company.\nLet us learn to tarry in the presence of the Lord until the breath (wind) of God comes over our lives. It is then that the dry bone will come alive.
