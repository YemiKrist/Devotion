Jesus in His pains noticed their emotions and addressed them comfortingly that they should be less concern for Him now but rather prepare themselves to receive something worse than His own that will soon come upon them from the very same people-the Romans. In their despair then, they will hope for any other kind of death in preference of what they would face. This prediction came to pass about forty years later -70AD.',

NO.\nThis is same with Cain when he offered a sacrifice unacceptable to God and thereafter got angry with God. Gen. 3:11-13; 4:3-7.

              introduction:
                  'False witnessing is one of the common sins in our generation which has caused numerous havoc among friends, families, church and workplace. It is one of the ten (10) commandments in Exodus 20 which God commanded that we should not engage in. It means saying what is not true about someone or destroying the good character of another person.\nOur Lord Jesus Christ made references to it when men asked Him what they needed to do to please God Mark 10:17-19; King Solomon in the book of Proverbs exposes the characters of those who bear false witness: they tell lies 6:19; 14:5; caused fight among brothers 6:19 and become a dangerous companion 25:18. Ps. 27:12 confirms that false witnessing is a source of cruelty. They destroy destiny and rejoice in seeing the downfall of their targets. Naboth and Stephen were quick figures that were destroyed and cut short through the antics of false witnesses. Even when Jesus was arrested, they sought for false witnesses against him. Why do people bear false witness against another person? Let’s discuss.',

                  'False witnesses are dangerous, hateful and inventors of wickedness. Their aim is to run down, kill or destroy another man. Devil is the originator of false witness as recorded in Gen. 3:1-8 where he was telling Eve that God didn’t love them by instructing them not to eat from the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. False witnessing could be done before the person they are running down or behind him. Those who engage in this vice were envious of the person or feel threatened by the progress of the person or want to get the position or possession of the person or are not just happy with the person. It takes God to deliver a man from the actions of false witnesses. Proverbs 25:18 says they are maul (axe), sword and sharp arrow. Everything about them is evil and wickedness.',

Biological motives are primary motives and it’s examples include hunger, thirst, need for oxygen, need for sleep, sex motive, avoidance of pain and so on while social needs, which are secondary needs include achievement motive, aggressive motive, power motive, acquisitive motive and curiousity. Personal motives include habits, goals of life, levels of aspiration, attitudes and interests. As a Christian, two other types must be added to these three namely religious motive (based on the traditions handed over by the so called religious leaders) and spiritual motive (based on the word of God and dictates of the Holy Spirit).\nMotives are so important because they drive our actions. When it is understood, handling people and actions become easier. A.W Tozer wrote, ”The test by which all conduct must finally be judged is motive. As water cannot be higher than it’s source, so the moral quality in an act can never be higher than the motive that inspires it…”\nA.W Tozer also provided an answer to how one can discern his motive. He said “a good way to avoid the snare of empty religious activity is to appear before God once in a while with our Bible opened to 1Cor. 13 . .. the Apostle makes the highest religious service and consigns it to futility unless it is motivated by love.”',

                  'What is flattery? It can be defined as excessive and insincere praise especially that given to further one’s own interest. The sin of flattery is a form of lies, deception and hypocrisy Ps. 78:36. The word appears 21 times in the Bible, 20 times in the Old Testament and once in the New Testament. It is possible for someone to flatter himself or another person. He that will be upright before God must run away from flattery and put those who flatter him away from himself.\nIt is corruption and the consequence is grievous. Those who perpetuate such evil act gain favour from the person at first but when it is finally discovered, he will lose more than what he had ever gained.',

He further stated that the children of those who flatter shall eat from the fruit of their parent’s evil act Job 17:5. King David also kept himself from the sin and even preached against it Ps. 12:3; 5:9. Flatterers are double dealers, wicked and unfaithful. Oh! what a wicked class of people that must be avoided.\nOur memory verse clearly declared that flattery is a manifestation of hatred and it hurts the person being flattered.\nBut, some people love to be flattered, that is they love sycophants around them who will be telling them what they are not. Such are wicked themselves and deceitful.\nIt is dangerous to call yourself what you are not or allow someone to deceive you into thinking you are more than who you are.',
